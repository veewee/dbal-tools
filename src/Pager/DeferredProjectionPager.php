 * pager for a narrow row, which pays nothing for a CTE it does not need.
 *
 * PostgreSQL evaluates window functions before `ORDER BY`/`LIMIT` at the same query level, so
 * `COUNT(1) OVER()` buffers every matching row before the page is cut. Over a `jsonb_build_object`
 * projection those buffered rows are kilobytes wide and spill to temp files. Here the count window sits on
 * a narrow query selecting `$key` alone, which is then folded into a CTE and joined back to the fat
 * projection: the true total is still computed over the whole matching set, but out of `(key, total)` rows.
